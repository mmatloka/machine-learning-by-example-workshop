## Machine learning by example

Slides can be found [here](http://www.slideshare.net/SoftwareMill/machine-learning-by-example).

The example notebook requires [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/). You can easily setup it together with spark using [docker-zeppelin](https://github.com/dylanmei/docker-zeppelin) image.

From Apache Zeppelin UI import the note file.
